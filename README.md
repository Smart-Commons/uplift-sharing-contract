## Smart Commons Solidity (ETH) Prototype

### Installation.
First of all, download & install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganachehttps://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) 

Then clone the project to your computer.
`$ git clone git@github.com:lucidmindsai/smart-commons.git`

Navigate to the project's root folder.
`$ cd smart-commons`

Install all the project dependencies. Before that make sure you have `npm` installed in your computer. If not check [NPM Website](https://www.npmjs.com/https://www.npmjs.com/) for installation guideline.

If `npm` is in place, install all the dependencies:
`$ npm install`

### __Attention.__
> Please note that all configuration to your local Ganache blockchain i.e.,Â `127.0.0.1:7545` is already configured. On the other hand the default file structure of this Truffle project is changed: Smart contract files are moved under `/src` directory so the ***React App*** can reach them easily.

Now compile the whole project:
`$ truffle compile`

Run the migrations:
`$ truffle migration`

> This is very similar to running migration on standart databases. But keep in mind that __blockchain is immutable__.

To test if everything is in place, let's do a quick try on the truffle console:

`$ truffle console`

Then get a copy of the Smart Contract:
`truffle(development)> smartcommons = await SmartCommons.deployed()`

Retrieve the address of the contract:
`> smartcommons.address`

Get the name of the contract (check the constructor)
`name = await smartcommons.name()`
This will return `undefined`. Type `name` to see the result on the console.

Last but not least, run the whole test suite:
`$ truffle test`
